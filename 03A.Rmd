In Part 3, we will generalize what we learn from Part 2 to ODEs with two variables and apply them to model a gene circuit with two nodes. We will focus on phase plane analysis for a visual characterization of nonlinear dynamical systems.

# A system with two variables
We first model the toggle switch circuit with two genes $X$ and $Y$, whose dynamics can be described by a set of two ODEs below (*i.e.*, equation (13) in Part 2A). 

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases} \frac{dX}{dt} = g_{X0}\frac{1}{1+(Y/Y_0)^{n_Y}} - k_XX \\
              \frac{dY}{dt} = g_{Y0}\frac{1}{1+(X/X_0)^{n_X}} - k_YY \end{cases}
\end{equation}
