## Numerical Methods using R

---

The purpose of this tutorial is to illustrate the use of R programming in numerical analyses, which can easily lead to a large variaty of applications in science and engineering. I will cover basic elements of numerical methods and algorithms for solving differential equations, performing simulations and optimization. Rather than just showing how to do so with existing packages, I will focus on the details of each algorithm using R and provide its usage in the context of a real application in biological engineering. The tutorial is organized into a series of R Markdown files, each of which can be executed in RStudio.
