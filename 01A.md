## Why Using R?

R is a programming language designed for statistical computing and
graphics. Unlike a compiled language, such as C and Fortran, R is
typically used as an interpreted language. There are several reasons why
I choose R here.

  - R is simple to use. If you have some experience with any other
    programming language, it should be pretty easy to learn R.

  - R comes with an interactive environment for programming. Many users
    also use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) for R. It provides an
    integrated environment for coding and scripting and a user-friendly
    Graphic User Interface (GUI), very similar to Matlab. [Here is an
    article comparing R and Matlab.](https://hackr.io/blog/r-vs-matlab)

  - R is cross-platform. Both R and RStudio are available in Windows,
    Mac, and Linux.

  - Many R packages have been developed and are freely accessible for
    statistical analyses and biomedical research. R packages can usually
    be found via (1) [Github](https://github.com); (2) The Comprehensive
    R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org)); (3)
    [BioConductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) for bioinformatics.

  - It is not difficult to develop R packages. R also provides interface
    for other languages, such as C++ and Fortran, for computational
    efficiency.

  - R packages can also be easily converted into interactive web app
    using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com).

To get started, one needs to download and install R and RStudio from the
following websites: [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) and
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). I recommend R version 3.6.3 for
this tutorial.

From the R Console, type the following command to get help.

``` r
help(runif)     # show documentation for the topic -- runif in this example
```

## Learning R

I will not provide a detailed R tutorial, as they are already available.
I recommend the following resources for learning R.

  - [An Introduction to
    R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html)
    from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org)

  - [R & Bioconductor
    Manual](http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/R_BioCondManual)
    by Thomas Girke at UC Riverside

  - [Efficient R programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/)
    by Colin Gillespie & Robin Lovelace

Here, I will provide a brief overview of R syntax and highlight a few
R’s unique features.

#### Typical data types & math operations

``` r
a = 10 + 3.14    # integer, real number; assignment to a
a*a # a multiplies a
```

    ## [1] 172.6596

``` r
a**2 # square of a, which gives the same value as the previous one
```

    ## [1] 172.6596

``` r
b = 3.0 + 4.0i  # complex number; assignment to b
Mod(b) # The modulus of b
```

    ## [1] 5

``` r
c = (3 + 4 == 7)   # logical; c is TRUE
!c   # not c, which is FALSE
```

    ## [1] FALSE

``` r
d = "Monday"  # character
class(d)  # showing the data type of d
```

    ## [1] "character"

``` r
nchar(d)  # number of characters in a string
```

    ## [1] 6

#### Vectors

``` r
vec = c("Man","Woman","Woman","Man","Woman")   # a vector of characters
length(vec) #length of a vector
```

    ## [1] 5

``` r
vec == "Woman" # logic values comparing each element to "Woman"
```

    ## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

``` r
which(vec == "Woman") # identifying the indices of the elements being "Woman"
```

    ## [1] 2 3 5

#### Factors

Factor type is an important data type in R. It is commonly used to
represent categorical data.

``` r
vec_factor = as.factor(vec)   # converting the character vector to a factor vector
class(vec);class(vec_factor)  # checking the data types
```

    ## [1] "character"

    ## [1] "factor"

``` r
levels(vec_factor); nlevels(vec_factor)  # levels and the number of levels
```

    ## [1] "Man"   "Woman"

    ## [1] 2

#### If statement

``` r
a = 0
if(a == 1){   # conditions
  print("a equals to 1")
} else {
  print("a is not 1")
}
```

    ## [1] "a is not 1"

#### For loops

``` r
for (i in 1:5) print(i)   # version 1
```

    ## [1] 1
    ## [1] 2
    ## [1] 3
    ## [1] 4
    ## [1] 5

``` r
for (i in seq_len(5)) print(i)   # version 2
```

    ## [1] 1
    ## [1] 2
    ## [1] 3
    ## [1] 4
    ## [1] 5

``` r
v = c(1,2,5,7)
for (i in v){
  print(i)   # version 3
}
```

    ## [1] 1
    ## [1] 2
    ## [1] 5
    ## [1] 7

#### While statement

``` r
i = 0
while(i < 5){
  i = i + 2
  print(i)
}
```

    ## [1] 2
    ## [1] 4
    ## [1] 6

#### Apply

Another unique feature in R. Apply performs a function iteratively
through an array or matrix. It’s usually a more efficient way than a for
loop. Syntax: apply(X, MARGIN, FUN). Here, X is an array or matrix.
MARGIN=1 performs the specified function by rows, 2 by columns. FUN: is
the function to apply.

``` r
mat = matrix(rnorm(16), nrow = 4)    # generating a random matrix of 4 x 4
mat
```

    ##             [,1]        [,2]       [,3]       [,4]
    ## [1,] -0.45271617 -0.17471822  0.9607739 -1.5207998
    ## [2,]  0.05910815  0.08715925 -0.9524681  0.9642086
    ## [3,]  0.82229677 -0.03517838  0.1231471  0.4888823
    ## [4,] -1.33538375 -2.71496922 -0.6426534  0.9108534

``` r
apply(mat, 1, sum)   # row sum
```

    ## [1] -1.1874602  0.1580079  1.3991478 -3.7821530

``` r
rowSums(mat)   # An alternative way to do row sum
```

    ## [1] -1.1874602  0.1580079  1.3991478 -3.7821530

``` r
apply(mat, 2, sum)   # column sum
```

    ## [1] -0.9066950 -2.8377066 -0.5112005  0.8431445

``` r
colSums(mat)  # An alternative way to do column sum
```

    ## [1] -0.9066950 -2.8377066 -0.5112005  0.8431445

There are other apply-like functions, such as lappy, sappy, tapply,
*etc.* [Check here for more
details.](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-tutorial-apply-family)

#### Functions

``` r
myfunction <- function(x) {    # a simple function to perform x square
  x*x
}
b = myfunction(4)
print(paste0("b = ",b))
```

    ## [1] "b = 16"

#### List

Lists can contain elements of different types.

``` r
my_list = list("a", c(1,2,3), FALSE, 3.14)  # Defining a new list
my_list[[1]]   # the first element
```

    ## [1] "a"

``` r
my_list[[2]]   # the second element
```

    ## [1] 1 2 3

``` r
names(my_list) = c("letters", "array", "TF", "pi")  # naming list elements
my_list$TF   # retrieve elements by names
```

    ## [1] FALSE

``` r
my_vector = unlist(my_list)   # convert the list to a vector
my_vector
```

    ## letters  array1  array2  array3      TF      pi 
    ##     "a"     "1"     "2"     "3" "FALSE"  "3.14"
