## Why Using R?

R is a programming language designed for statistical computing and
graphics. Unlike a compiled language, such as C and Fortran, R is
typically used as an interpreted language. There are several reasons why
I choose R here.

  - R is simple to use. If you have some experience with any other
    programming language, it should be pretty easy to learn R.

  - R comes with an interactive environment for programming. Many users
    also use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) for R. It provides an
    integrated environment for coding and scripting and a user-friendly
    Graphic User Interface (GUI), very similar to Matlab. [Here is an
    article comparing R and Matlab.](https://hackr.io/blog/r-vs-matlab)

  - R is cross-platform. Both R and RStudio are available in Windows,
    Mac, and Linux.

  - Many R packages have been developed and are freely accessible for
    statistical analyses and biomedical research. R packages can usually
    be found via (1) [Github](https://github.com); (2) The Comprehensive
    R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org)); (3)
    [BioConductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) for bioinformatics.

  - It is not difficult to develop R packages. R also provides interface
    for other languages, such as C++ and Fortran, for computational
    efficiency.

  - R packages can also be easily converted into interactive web app
    using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com).

To get started, one needs to download and install R and RStudio from the
following websites: [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) and
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). I recommend R version 3.6.3 for
this tutorial.

From the R Console, type the following command to get help.

``` r
help(runif)     # show documentation for the topic -- runif in this example
```

## Learning R

I will not provide a detailed R tutorial, as they are already available.
