# Fourth order Runge-Kutta 

In part 2B Equation (6), we show a more accurate numerical integrator of ODEs: the fourth order Runge-Kutta method, or RK4. Please proof the method and calculate its accuracy in terms of $O(\Delta t)$

# Hysteresis

Consider the circuit with one self-activating gene, described by Equation (1) in Part 2D. Simulate the circuit by gradually increasing $k$ from 0.1 to 0.2, starting from the steady state when $k = 0.1$. Also simulate for another time the same circuit by gradually decreasing $k$ from 0.2 to 0.1, starting from the steady state when $k = 0.2$. Find the similarity and differences of the two time trajectories, *i.e.*, $X(t)$. 

# Anorther bifurcation analysis

Consider the circuit with one self-inhibiting gene, described by Equation (1) in Part 2E. Now, we would like to plot a bifurcation diagram for the circuit dynamics by selecting the time delay $\tau$ as the control parameter. For each $\tau$, simulate the circuit sufficiently long so that it reaches to either the stable steady state or, in the case of oscillatory dynamics, the stable oscillations. Plot the maximum and minimum $X$ of the stable trajectory $X(t)$ with respect to the control parameter $\tau$.
